# Terraform generated directories and files
# ----------------------------------------

# The .terraform directory stores downloaded provider plugins and modules.
# It should always be ignored as it can be large and is platform-specific.
**/.terraform/*

# The local state file is highly sensitive as it contains all infrastructure
# details, including potentially plaintext secrets. Never commit this.
# Use a remote backend (e.g., S3, Terraform Cloud) for state management.

# Saved plan files created with 'terraform plan -out=tfplan'

# Crash log files
crash.log

# Terraform CLI configuration files for local settings
.terraformrc

# Variable definition files
# -------------------------

# Ignore general .tfvars files as they frequently contain secrets, keys, or
# environment-specific data that shouldn't be in version control.
# If you need to commit a non-sensitive example, use a negation (see below).
